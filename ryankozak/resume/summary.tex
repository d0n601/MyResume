I've always been extremely interested in computer security, as well as general information security, and privacy.

My professional background has been in software engineering and Linux server administration. I have 10+ years experience deploying and administering Linux servers, both physically and in a cloud environment. Primarily my software development experience has been in PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, as well as various frameworks built upon those technologies. I also have practical experience in C, Python, C\#, and Java. 

I'd like to transition into a security focused role, rather than a development focused role, moving forward with my career. I believe my years of experience as a developer and systems administrator have given me practical insight into what can go wrong when securing an environment, both technically and non-technically.
