# My Resume #

Hello, what you're looking at is the public repository for my [resume](https://github.com/d0n601/MyResume/blob/master/ryankozak/resume.pdf).


### Credit ###

[Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.
